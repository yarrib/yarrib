- 👋 Hi, I’m Yarri (@yarrib). 

- 👀 I’m interested in
  - programming and data science
  - golf
  - fishing, hiking, and hunting
  - mountain biking
  - broomball
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many things, aside from pursuing my Masters' in Data Science (U of Wisconsin Online)
  - proper tools for version control, containerization, and related: git, github, docker, ci/cd stuff
  - always learning more about python and creating organized projects :)
  - Azure, specifically Azure Machine Learning and Databricks
  - Always learning a little bit about PowerBI at work
  - I really liked using Spark in school, specifically Scala as a language. For some reason I find it to be fairly elegant and a nice change. Working on using in a project soon.
  - Trying my hand at hackathons, small personal projects, leetcode exercises, and kaggle competitions/activities.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
  - Any fun project where I can grow skills
  - Things that are new to me or that I can learn by doing (failing, also!)
